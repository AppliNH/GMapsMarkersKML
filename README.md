# GMapsMarkersKML
A custom GMaps displaying your markers from a .KML file on the map and on a list, where each item is clickable and has an interaction with the associated marker on the GMap.

Your just have to add your APIKEY in the head of the file, as well as the link to your "connected .KML file" you can generate via the MyMaps you created on your Google Drive.

I'm using JQUERY/Javascript/HTML/CSS 

(focused on functionnalities, not design/frontend)
